# About

This application is deployed using Vercel. This will be used to display my training plan (run and strength) each day for the Beantown Marathon on Sep. 7, 2025, for my eventual Boston Qualification! It also includes a daily slider scale to measure and record how I am feeling each day and a rotating picture of the character Gudetama to lift spirits.
